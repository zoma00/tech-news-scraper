## Data Scraper with  Scrapy splash using Docker container: (splash render JavaScript)

This project provides a Scrapy spider named `Myspider` designed to extract restaurant data from example.com. It can handle both:

**Standard HTML Parsing:**
-  Scrapy's core functionalities are used for efficient HTML content extraction.
JavaScript Rendering :
Integration with Splash(Docker scraping hub splash container) ([https://splash.readthedocs.io/](https://splash.readthedocs.io/)) allows the spider to handle JavaScript-rendered content dynamically (requires separate installation).

**Features:**

- **Selective Data Extraction:**
- Targets specific restaurant elements (URLs, titles, descriptions) using Scrapy selectors (CSS and XPath).
- **Robust Error Handling:** Handles potential errors like missing attributes, type errors, Splash request errors, and unexpected status codes.
- **Detailed Logging:** Uses Python's logging module for informative messages (info, warning, error, debug) to aid debugging and monitoring.
- **CSV Output (Optional):** Provides a basic `write_to_csv` function to save extracted data in CSV format (requires adjustment for your needs).

**How to Use:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - `pip install scrapy` (core Scrapy library)
   - **Optional:** `pip install scrapy-splash` (for JavaScript rendering with Splash)
2. **Adjust Configuration:**
   - Update `start_urls` to match the specific Example.com area you want to crawl (e.g., change "scrap factor " to your desired location).
   - Modify selectors (CSS and XPath) in `parse` to match the actual HTML structure of the Example.com page you're targeting.
   - Adjust the CSV output path in `write_to_csv` if needed.
3. **Run the Spider:** Execute `python your_script_name.py`.

**Potential Enhancements:**

Splash Integration and Lua Scripting: If applicable, integrate Splash and leverage **Lua scripting** for dynamic content rendering and custom actions.
Pagination Handling: Implement robust pagination handling within parse to follow next-page links and extract data across multiple pages.
Advanced Data Storage: Explore more sophisticated data storage solutions like databases or cloud storage instead of basic CSV output.
Modularity: Refactor the code into separate modules for better reusability and maintainability.
**Additional Considerations:**

- Check Example.com's terms of use or robots.txt for any crawling restrictions.
- This is a basic structure; consider extending it based on the website's complexity and your data extraction requirements.
